# Linux System Distribution
## A central repository for future builds
When I first got into Linux, I kept forgetting what commands I'd need to
run, or where I could place files and programs following a universal(ish)
standard.

After several years of building Linux experience, I still forget. Hence,
this directory was put together to combine my config files, system notes,
and other documents I feel like I'd need to quickly build up my system
whenever I spin up a new distro or reinstall an existing one.

This will grow as I continue to collate my configuration (as I have 
several Linux systems, all with different distros).

I have been messing around and learning FreeBSD, as opposed to
Linux/Arch. After completely annihilating my Arch distro (yet
again), due to failure to properly update it (skill issue, I 
know), I decided to test some other distros out. I like the
Arch ecosystem, so I was going to use EndeavorOS, but I 
decided to be even more obscure and go with FreeBSD. It's
different and I have much to learn, but there's an incredible
Linux compatibility layer that I plan to leverage when I code
on the new system. Hopefully it will be a lot more stable than
my previous Arch builds.

Hence, this branch (non-stow) has been stripped of much of
what I had originally made this repo for. So far, it has my
Vim config (neovim is a port in FreeBSD, which I don't want to
get into yet; I'm using and might stick with regular Vim) and
assorted notes on Linux. When I get my FreeBSD system (named
DEVIL-1), to a point where I can operate effectively in it,
this branch will have more configuration files added to it.
