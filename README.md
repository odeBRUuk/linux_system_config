# Linux System Distribution
## A central repository for future builds
When I first got into Linux, I kept forgetting what commands I'd need to
run, or where I could place files and programs following a universal(ish)
standard.

After several years of building Linux experience, I still forget. Hence,
this directory was put together to combine my config files, system notes,
and other documents I feel like I'd need to quickly build up my system
whenever I spin up a new distro or reinstall an existing one.

This will grow as I continue to collate my configuration (as I have 
several Linux systems, all with different distros).
